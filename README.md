   - Each tenant_id creates an isolated environment for your data

2. **Login to the Platform**:
   - Use your credentials to log in at the main page
   - Your JWT token will be stored securely for later API calls

### Using the Chat Interface

1. **Creating Conversations**:
   - Click the "+" button in the sidebar to start a new conversation
   - Give your conversation a meaningful title for easy reference
   - Each conversation is stored with your tenant_id for data isolation

2. **Interacting with the AI**:
   - Type your message in the input field and press Enter or click the send button
   - The AI response will stream in real-time with token-by-token updates
   - Messages are displayed with clear user/assistant avatars for easy distinction
